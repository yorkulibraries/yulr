* yulr

** Overview

=yulr= is a set of small helper functions for R work at York University Libraries: little things to save time that were getting repeated in code in various places, which are better managed in a proper library

** Installation

Install from GitHub with =devtools=.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :eval no
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install("yorkulibraries/yulr")
#+END_SRC

If you get an error like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Error in system(full, intern = quiet, ignore.stderr = quiet, ...) :
error in running command
#+END_EXAMPLE

then this will probably fix it:

#+BEGIN_SRC R :eval no
options(unzip = "internal")
#+END_SRC

** TO DO

A vignette.

** Bugs

None known.
